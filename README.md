-[Node.JS](#node.js)

## Apache
Apache is a software that serves as a web server to deliver or serve websites on the internet. Now remember, it is a web server, not a physical server, however it does runs on the physical server to act as the middle man between a client (browser) and a server. That is, a client will request a file from the server, the request will first go to the apache server to process and it will pull what it needs from the server to and send it back to the client.

As a web server software, Apache can have modules added to increase its functionality. This includes a module for server side languages such as PHP, Perl or Lua to send files to a client that is modified based on certain settings/parameters sent to the server. So, essentially, what happens when you request a .php file from the apache server is that the apache server will access the php interpreter from the php module and run the php file so that it creates an HTML file to serve.

To configure Apache settings, there is a text file you need open up and edit. You need to configure this file for the domain name, module use, etc.

Nginx is another web server simiiar to Apache, however it was made with more heavy traffic in mind.
